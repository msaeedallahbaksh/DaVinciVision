# DaVinciVision üé®
Aim is to build CNN prediction models which predict which artist created an artwork.

## File Explanation
- gitignore - contains file types to ignore for git.
- Image-Vis.mp4 - Video version of HSV Distribution of Van Gogh Painting
- TODO.md - contains broad next steps for the project.
- EDA - Directory containing Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Analysis.ipynb - Jupyter notebook overlooking Feature analysis for the NN
    - ImageDimensionResearch.ipynb - jupyter notebook entailing different resizing function.
- Model-Development
    - FilterGenerator.py - Custom Generator I built. Handles the insertion of new feature dimesions, data augmentation, class-weighting correction, one-hot-encoding, etc...
    - ModelTrain.py - Python Class which accepts numerous inputs ( model-architecture, hyperparameters, etc...) then has a function which allows you train the results and receive the feed back back as a dictionary. 
    - Tuning*.ipynb - rough draft of tuning & training notebooks. These notebooks basically just call the ModelTrain Class and train a series of models with given hyperparameters.
    - Results - Directory recording the training results. Each of the files inside is a pickle file in the form of a list, with each index containing a dictionary regarding a training session.

## Downloading Data
1. Pull the Repo. 
2. Download this dataset and **copy the directory where you saved it**.
3. Navigate to the *helpers/SetDataLocation.py* file and change the vlaue for the *path_to_dataset* variables with correct file path splitting for your os ( / - for windows )
4. Run the SetDataLocation.py File. Now you can work with the EDA noteobooks! üëè

## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time

| This dataset consists of three files. It is 2.32 GB in size which seems promising to train a quality DL model. There are a total of 8446 images (artworks) and 50 artists (classes). 

* artists.csv: A dataset containing information for each artist.
* images.zip: A collection of full-sized images, divided into folders and sequentially numbered.
* resized.zip: A resized version of the image collection, extracted from the folder structure for faster processing.
